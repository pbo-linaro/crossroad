Release procedure
=================

* Create a dist file:

    $ ./setup.py sdist

* Install the dist file. Let's suppose current version is 0.4.4:

    $ cd dist
    $ tar xzf crossroad-0.4.4.tar.gz
    $ cd crossroad-0.4.4
    $ ./setup.py build
    $ ./setup.py install --prefix=/home/jehan/.local

* Test it. If it does not work well, fix the repository and go back to
the first step.
In particular, check that all the right scripts are there (else fix the
setup.py and MANIFEST.in)

* Update `version` variable in setup.py.
The versionning scheme used would be the typical X.Y.Z (also called
semantic versionning by some people: http://semver.org/), though
I may be lax on this scheme until 1.0.

* Commit the version bump:

    $ git commit setup.py

* Tag the commit. Add a list of the main changes in the tag message:

    $ git tag -a v0.5
    # note: replace 0.5 with actual version.

* Push the tag:

    $ git push origin v0.5

* Upload to pypi by running:

    $ ./setup.py sdist upload

* Check that the upload worked:

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/crossroad/

* Install crossroad from pypi and ensure everything worked out fine:

    $ sudo pip3 install --upgrade crossroad
